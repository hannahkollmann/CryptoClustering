# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, you’ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


## Steps
1. Prepare the Data.
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data.
4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data.
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data.
7. Visualize and Compare the Results using hvPlot. 

## Results
The results of this project includes the visualizations below. A Jupyter Notebook was used to create and edit the code. Therefore, these visualizations will not show up in Github and MUST run through Jupyter Notebook. Credit goes to my classmates and Slack Overflow for helping me with the composite charts.
