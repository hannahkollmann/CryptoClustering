# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


## Steps
1. Prepare the Data.
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data.
4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data.
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data.
7. Visualize and Compare the Results using hvPlot.
